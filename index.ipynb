    "# NoSQL Databases - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference is that a SQL database is Structured.\n",
    "While a noSQL works more like a dictionary.\n",
    "The noSQL is definitely better because has less redundancy and the actual database is stored in multiple servers making it more reliable and efficient.\n",
    "The downside of a noSQL database is that the queries are a little more complicated, because we need to remember the keys where we store the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we have to store data for 2 different people.\n",
    "We have so 2 ID's, and the first one presents attributes that the second doesn't have.\n",
    "Now in a SQL database we have to write down all the null values for the second ID because using structured tables all data must be put inside.\n",
    "In this scenario a noSQL database would be more efficient allowing us to input data just if present for the specific ID. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How does MongoDB work? How is it different from a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "MongoDB is a noSQL database and in particular a Document Store.\n",
    "Differs form a relational database because this one is a structured database while Mongo is not.\n",
    "Mongo is a database that stores records as unique documents.\n",
    "Can be arbitrary long, not like a SQL database, and can contain documents inside a document.\n",
    "Each document contains key, value pairs.\n",
    "It's so much more flexible, making each document potentially unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "A Resilient Distributed Dataset(RDD) is a collection of multiple servers that share data from databases beetween all these servers.\n",
    "Each server contains data about a proper database plus a backup of data of other databases.\n",
    "Fault tollerance refers to the safe-method used from the RDD, basically if 1 or more servers are not working for some reasons this system is still able to access all the data of the database thanks to the backups.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Hadoop is one of the main platforms supporting RDD.\n",
    "MapReduce is the main key behind the RDD mechanism, basiically there are multiple servers containing data.\n",
    "When we need results just from a server for part of the data we do this without using like the older models all the server data making the resarch more quick.\n",
    "When we need all the data the system combine all the server to work together(reduce) so the result also in this case is much more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we reviewed some common NoSQL interview questions. "
